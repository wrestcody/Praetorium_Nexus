# Praetorium_Nexus

Praetorium_Nexus is the strategic command post for the GRC-Copilot ecosystem. It serves as a secure single source of truth, an API ingestion hub, and a risk visualization platform.

## Three-Part Architecture

The GRC-Copilot ecosystem consists of three components:

1.  **KSI_Engine**: The source of compliance data.
2.  **Vanguard_Agent**: Enriches the compliance data with AI-powered risk scoring and natural language summaries.
3.  **Praetorium_Nexus**: Ingests the enriched data from the Vanguard_Agent and provides a centralized platform for visualizing and managing risk.

Praetorium_Nexus is designed to support FedRAMP ATOs by providing continuously verified, auditable data.
